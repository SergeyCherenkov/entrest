**entrest** is an [EntGo](https://entgo.io/) extension for generating compliant OpenAPI
specs and an HTTP handler implementation that matches that spec. It expands upon the
approach used by [entoas](https://github.com/ent/contrib/tree/master/entoas#entoas),
with additional functionality, and pairs the generated specification with a
fully-functional HTTP handler implementation.

- ✨ Generates OpenAPI specs for your EntGo schema.
- ✨ Generates a fully functional HTTP handler implementation that matches the OpenAPI spec.
- ✨ Supports automatic pagination (where applicable).
- ✨ Supports advanced filtering (using query parameters, `AND`/`OR` predicates, etc).
- ✨ Supports eager-loading edges, so you don't have to make additional calls unnecessarily.
- ✨ Supports various forms of sorting.
- ✨ And more!

:::tip
It is recommended to read through the [EntGo getting started guide](https://entgo.io/docs/getting-started/) before proceeding to get a better understanding of EntGo.

Additionally, to load extensions with additional configuration, using EntGo's [entc integration](https://entgo.io/docs/code-gen/#use-entc-as-a-package) is required.

## Project Structure

We recommend a project structure that looks similar to this:

<FileTree>
- internal
  - ...
  - database
    - ent/             contains all entgo-generated code
      - ...
      - rest/          HTTP handler, OpenAPI spec & entrest code
    - schema/          entgo schemas (w/ entrest annotations)
      - ...
      - schema_foo.go
      - schema_bar.go
    - entc.go          entc logic (where to load entrest)
  - generate.go        used to trigger all internal codegen logic, including pinning codegen dependencies.
- main.go              main entrypoint for the application, mount HTTP handler, custom endpoints, etc
</FileTree>

##### Why?

There are a few reasons why we recommend this structure:

- Generated code is isolated in its own folder. In most cases, you can simply ignore the folder in your editor, so it's less distracting.
- Schemas aren't buried compared to the standard entgo setup.
- All database-related code is explicitly in an `internal/` folder, which is best practice for logic that shouldn't be imported by external packages.

##### Future Growth

As the complexity of your project grows, it may be worth separating out logic even further. Some examples:

- HTTP logic -- `main.go -> http.go`.
- Initializing the DB client/migrations -- `main.go -> internal/database/client.go`
- Multiple "main" entrypoints (API backend, CLI, worker(s), etc) -- `main.go -> cmd/http-server/main.go`

## Initialize Project

You can find a full example project that matches this guide [here](https://github.com/lrstanley/entrest/tree/master/_examples/simple).

<Steps>

1. Start by initializing a new Go project:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p my-project && cd my-project
    go mod init github.com/example/my-project
    ```

2. Setup subfolder for schema files:

    ```bash
    mkdir -p internal/database/schema
    ```

3. Add a few schema files:

    Example `Pet` schema, which also has a few edge relationships, one of which we eager load. Take note of some of of the attached annotations:

    <Code
        code={clean(FileSchemaPet)}
        lang="go"
        ins={[/entrest\..*/g, /[^ ]+\/entrest.*/g]}
        wrap
        title="internal/database/schema/pet.go"
    />

    Example `User` schema, which also has a single edge relationship, which we eager load. Take note of some of of the attached annotations:

    <Code
        code={clean(FileSchemaUser)}
        lang="go"
        ins={[/entrest\..*/g, /[^ ]+\/entrest.*/g]}
        wrap
        title="internal/database/schema/user.go"
    />

4. Add an `internal/database/entc.go` file, which is used to configure the extension, and run code generation. Make sure to replace the <Badge text="github.com/example/my-project" variant="tip" size="small" /> module references with your module name.

    <Code
        code={clean(FileEntC)}
        lang="go"
        ins={[{range: "14-21"}, 30, /[^ ]+\/entrest.*/g]}
        mark={[/github\.com\/example\/[^"]+/g]}
        wrap
        title="internal/database/entc.go"
    />

5. Add a `internal/generate.go` file, where the `go:generate` comment is used to trigger all internal codegen logic. This file is also used to pin codegen dependencies:

    <Code
        code={clean(FileGenerate)}
        lang="go"
        ins={/[^ ]+\/entrest.*/g}
        mark={/.*go:generate.*/g}
        wrap
        title="internal/generate.go"
    />

6. Add a `main.go` file, which mounts the HTTP handler, and initializes the database client:

    <Code
        code={clean(FileMain)}
        lang="go"
        ins={[/[^ ]+ent\/rest.*/g, /.*rest\.NewServer.*/g, /.*srv\.Handler.*/g]}
        wrap
        title="main.go"
    />

7. Lastly, run code generation:

    ```bash
    go generate -x ./...
    ```
</Steps>

That's it! You should now have a fully-functional project that uses entrest. This includes:

1. A managed database schema using [EntGo](https://entgo.io/).
2. A fully-functional HTTP handler implementation using [chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) (or any other HTTP router that supports `net/http`).
3. A fully-functional OpenAPI spec, which can be used to generate client libraries, or to validate requests (see `internal/database/ent/rest/openapi.json`).

## Running The Server

To run the application, simply run the following commands to download all dependencies, then run the application:

```bash
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

<Code code={`
[...]
go: downloading github.com/go-playground/assert/v2 v2.0.1
[...]
running http server
`} lang="console" frame="none" class="code-output" />

## Next Steps

Now that you've got a basic HTTP API setup, you can start making API requests to it, or further customizing it.
