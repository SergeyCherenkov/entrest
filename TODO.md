## TODO

- differences over entx
  - struct that wraps everything?
  - hooks, on a per schema level?
  - functions exposed to do everything, with varying levels of abstraction.
    - make it super easy to map from ent -> ogen?
  - make it easy to disable edge endpoint?
  - if edge is eager loaded, the eager loaded endpoint shouldn't be paginated.
- overridable functions for handling naming?
- http handlers
  - generic handler, with overridable function to get the id from the url?
  - additional "helpers" for easily mapping things like chi?
- easier way to have custom endpoints that also use ent data types (e.g. `/settings/<id>` -> `/settings` if there is only one)
  - `Singular()` annotation?
- sort with null as last?
  - maybe we need more configurability here?
- entity -> query edge vs query edge by `from`'s ID (so don't need to query extra data).
- jq middleware
- can we generate any kind of testing functions and/or add helpers to make testing easier?
- ideas:
  - <https://learn.openapis.org/best-practices.html#describing-large-apis>
  - <https://tyk.io/blog/10-essentials-when-creating-an-open-api-specification/>
- generate markdown stuff in the main openapi description? maybe markdown table stuff?
- error when annotations are added to the wrong origin type?
  - how to do this? in the <type>Annotation() functions, somehow?
- allow using {somefield} rather than {id}? fails if field is not unique?
- openapi diff tool?
- support native searching? maybe using querystring?
- add endpoints for grouping (with filtering), e.g. {"results": [{"foo": 123", "bar": 100, "baz": 51}]}
- make sure to test LIST but no READ (making sure we still populate <entity>Read if needed, but only if needed).
- 404 should be used for not-found things, but it should have a different inner code to tell that the server received, but didn't find the specific entity.
- test skipping all ops for a given entity.
- add api changelog somehow? could we make it easier for others to track their API changes?
- how are sensitive fields handled at the moment?
- support links for ids between entities/endpoints? <https://swagger.io/docs/specification/links/>
- optional X-Request-ID as header parameter
- readme should contain "best practices" section on adding defaults, examples, comments, etc.
- should add "decisions" section to readme, indicating why certain decisions were made.
- global error code logic -- we shouldn't enforce anything by default.
- TODO: if something is eager loaded, it shouldn't be paginated on the dedicated endpoint?
