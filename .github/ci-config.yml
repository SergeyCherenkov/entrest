  ## :page_with_curl: Documentation

  Documentation is generated using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/). To run the docs locally, you will need:

  - Node.js 18+
  - pnpm
  - make

  Then, run the following from the root of the repo:

  ```bash
  make docs-debug
  ```

  ## :pushpin: All other contributions

  For all other contributions (bug fixes, feature additions, adding examples, etc), you will need the following installed:

  - Go (almost always the latest stable version)
  - make
  - **recommended**: [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) (latest version)
  - **recommended**: [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) (latest version)

  Once you have the above installed, you can run the following from the root of the repo:

  ```bash
  make test
  ```

  This will do the following:

  1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and in-sync with the code.
  2. Ensure any code-generation for the core module is up-to-date.
  3. Run ent code-generation for all examples.
  4. Run tests for all examples (multiple times).
  5. Run tests for the core module.

  During rapid prototyping, you may wish to only run `make examples` for examples, or `go test -v ./...` for the core
  module. See the contents of the [Makefile](Makefile) for more information on specifics.

  Make sure you read the [Go](hamster-golang) section.
